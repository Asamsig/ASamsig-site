# ASamsig-site
This site is a static website created with [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/) and [Slinky](https://slinky.dev), built based on the [Slinky docs](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/tree/master/docs).

I build this site to experiment with Scala.js, Slinky (React), Github Actions, static website hosting, AWS S3 and CloudFront.
